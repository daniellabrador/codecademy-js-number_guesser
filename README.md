## Project Prompt

In this project, you’ll write four functions in `script.js`. We’ve provided some additional JavaScript code in `game.js` that will call your functions based on user interactions, but you don’t need to look at `game.js` and shouldn’t edit it if you want your project to work as intended. As you complete this project, make sure that all of your functions are named exactly as specified so that they can be called correctly when the game is played.
